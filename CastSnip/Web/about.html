        <p>
            Cast/Snip is the result of trying to figure out a way to easily share
            short clips of a podcast I co-host, <a href="https://mostlysecurity.com">Mostly&nbsp;Security</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I thought it would be fun to post short clips on social media - and what started out as a
            little side project ended up (unintentionally) as a poor imitation of a podcast
            player.  It has been a fun project. ðŸ˜‰
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope you enjoy using Cast/Snip as much as I did building it.

        <b>PostScript:</b> Since the original release of Cast/Snip in March 2019, other <i>actual</i>
        podcast apps added clip sharing (see <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a> or <a href="https://castro.fm">Castro</a>).
        I removed it from the App Store in August of 2019 because I had no intention of making
        Cast/Snip into an actual podcast player.  It was more of a fun engineering exercise.
        </p>
        <p>After some urging from friends, I'm reposting it
        to the App Store for anyone who might be interested in using it for
        what it is, along with the complete source code;
        available on the <a href="https://github.com/mostlysecurity/">Mostly Security GitHub</a>.
